[`Kenya Music Festival`](https://kenyamusicfestival.com/) is a Movers company website created by[`CeasorCodes`](https://ceasorcodes.vercel.app/)
The Kenya Music Festival is a prestigious event that showcases the
rich and diverse musical talents of the Kenyan people. The
festival aims to promote cultural exchange, artistic excellence
and national unity through music. The website for the festival is
designed and developed by me, using the latest technologies and
frameworks. I used Next.js, a React-based framework that enables
fast and scalable web development. I also used Tailwind CSS, a
utility-first CSS framework that allows me to create custom and
responsive designs with ease. Finally, I used Framer Motion, a
library that provides powerful and intuitive animation features
for React components. The website has a modern and elegant look,
with smooth transitions and animations that enhance the user
experience. The website also has reusable components that are used
in various pages of the website, such as the header, footer,
navigation bar and cards. These components help to maintain
consistency and reduce code duplication. The website is fully
responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
The website showcases the festival's history, objectives,
programs, sponsors, partners and performers. It also provides
information on how to participate, register, buy tickets and
contact the organizers. The website is a reflection of my passion
and skills as a web developer, and I am proud to have contributed
to the success of the Kenya Music Festival.
