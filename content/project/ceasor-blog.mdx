[`CeasorCodes`](https://ceasorcodes.vercel.app/) is a blog | portfolio website created by
[`CeasorCodes`](https://ceasorcodes.vercel.app/)

This Next.js project is a modern web application that leverages the power of TailwindCSS and Shadcn for a sleek, responsive design.
It utilizes MDX to seamlessly integrate JSX within markdown content, allowing for dynamic components like interactive charts and alerts to be embedded directly into the narrative flow.
For an enhanced developer experience, it features a Rehype plugin with Shiki syntax highlighting, ensuring that code blocks are not only visually appealing but also accurately represented, both during server-side builds and on the client-side for real-time interactions.

## Blockquotes

> the present is our past.
```

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

## Inline code

```mdx
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

## Syntax highlighting

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):

````mdx
```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```
````

And here's how it looks - nicely colored with styled code titles!

```jsx
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' });
  }
}
```

## Footnotes

```mdx
Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference.
```

[^1]: My reference.

## Task Lists

```mdx
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
```

- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```mdx
| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
```

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

## Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear ~~crossed out~~.
