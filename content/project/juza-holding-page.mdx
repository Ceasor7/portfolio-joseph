[`Juza Holding Page`](https://juza-holding-page.vercel.app/) is a App Town Technologies Ltd holding page created by
[`CeasorCodes`](https://ceasorcodes.vercel.app/) A website holding page serves as a temporary placeholder for a website that is under construction or undergoing maintenance.
It typically features a clean, simple design with a concise message informing visitors of the site's status. Often, it includes a contact form or email address for inquiries and a timeline for when the site is expected to be live.
This page ensures that visitors are aware of the upcoming site and can still reach out to the website owners during the interim.
